### Options

Tools > Options > Miscellaneous > Rainbow

If you would like to use this plugin for specific mime-types, please modify `Regex for mime-types`.

Colors are customizable.

#### Skip options

If you would like to show colorized braces in comments and strings, please uncheck the below options.

- Skip comments (Checked by default)
- Skip strings (Checked by default)

#### Max number of lines

Braces are not colorized if lines of a file greater than this number.


#### Check only parentheses/brackets/braces of a visible area (Unchecked by default)

Don't check all braces from the top/end of the file. So, colors may be changed when you scroll the editor. But performance is better.
